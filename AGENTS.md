## Testing agent prompt assets

The Markdown files under `assets/agents/` and `assets/agents-md/` are prompt
prose. Never write tests that pin their wording: no `strings.Contains` on
sentences or phrases, no required-phrase lists, no section-order index checks.
Such tests freeze the phrasing instead of the behavior, so every prompt edit
becomes a test-fixing chore without catching real regressions.

Test functional contracts instead:

- **Install behavior** — assets are cataloged and installed byte-identical
  (`TestAgentAssetsAreCatalogedAndInstalledUnchanged`,
  `TestExistingOrchestratorCopyRequiresUpdatedSourceAndSelectedReconciliation`).
- **Structured data the code consumes** — frontmatter fields the harness reads
  (`TestAgentFrontmatterRemainsStructurallySafe`).

If a prompt rule feels worth guarding, extract the machine-checkable part — a
name, a schema, a config value, an installer behavior — and test that. Never
the sentence.
