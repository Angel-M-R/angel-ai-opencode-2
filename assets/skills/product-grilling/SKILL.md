# Product grilling

Interrogate the product assumptions behind a change BEFORE any planning
artifact exists. The goal is a short list of confirmed product decisions, not
a document.

## Rules

- Ask ONE question at a time with the `question` tool, then STOP and wait.
  Never batch questions, never continue past an unanswered question.
- This applies to every request for user input, including confirmations,
  corrections, round selection, and the final decision-list confirmation.
  Never put a question in prose or ask the user to reply in plain text. Present
  any summary first, then invoke the `question` tool and STOP.
- Offer concrete answer options and put your recommended one first, marked as
  recommended. The user decides; you never assume.
- Facts are yours, decisions are theirs: anything discoverable from the
  codebase, docs, or existing project documents you investigate with tools —
  never ask the user something you can look up.
- Treat the bounded change selected by the interview preflight as the scope.
  Do not reopen deferred subsystems during questioning; retain them as later
  work or explicit non-goals.
- 3–5 questions per round. After a round, summarize the assumptions collected
  so far and ask: correct something / another round / continue to planning.
- Match the user's conversation language.

## Question territory

Pick the questions that expose the biggest unknowns for THIS change; skip
territory that is already obvious or answered:

1. **Problem & trigger** — what hurts today, and what triggered doing this now?
2. **Target user & situation** — who exactly is this for, in what moment?
3. **Success outcome** — what observable change means it worked?
4. **Business rules & constraints** — invariants the solution must respect.
5. **Edge cases** — the weird inputs/situations that usually get discovered late.
6. **Impact of NOT doing it** — what happens if this ships never or later?
7. **First-slice scope** — the smallest version worth shipping.
8. **Non-goals** — what this change deliberately does NOT cover.
9. **Tradeoffs accepted** — what the user is willing to sacrifice (speed,
   polish, generality) and what they are not.

## Output

End with a `## Product decisions` bullet list: one line per confirmed decision,
including scope boundary and non-goals. Immediately invoke the `question` tool
to ask the user to confirm or correct it, then STOP. Never append that request
as prose. This brief feeds the technical interview (if any) and then the planner
— do not proceed until confirmed.
