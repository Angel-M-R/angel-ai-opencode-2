# Design comparison

[Back to the README](../README.md)

There are many harnesses and methodologies for coding agents. I compare these
eight because they cover approaches that interest me, although they do not all
cover the same layers themselves. This is not a benchmark and does not attempt to
declare a winner; it summarizes design differences.

## Agents

| Angel AI | Gentle AI | Oh My Pi | gstack | ECC | Superpowers | BMAD Method | Oh My OpenAgent |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 6 fixed subagents + 1 orchestrator | 18 fixed subagents + 1 orchestrator | 6 fixed agents + `advisor` | 23 specialists as skills/roles; no fixed roster | 67 fixed subagents + multi-agent commands | Dynamic harness subagents; no owned roster | 6 documented agents (12+ according to its README); Party Mode combines personas | [11 Ultimate agents](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent/blob/32d5a4e31746cf936e238ef31ea2cea53d5f02ac/docs/reference/features.md#agents); [optional Team Mode: lead + up to 8 members](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent/blob/32d5a4e31746cf936e238ef31ea2cea53d5f02ac/docs/reference/features.md#team-mode-experimental-off-by-default) |

In my current experience, more capable models, good compaction, and better use
of context reduce the need to divide work among many agents. <br/>
Usually I've gotten the same results using 2 agents as I have using 12, but cheaper.<br/>
I think having an orchestrating agent and delegating to subagents makes sense, but forcing delegation just because there are specific agents makes less and less sense as the models progress.

## Planning and interviews

| Angel AI | Gentle AI | Oh My Pi | gstack | ECC | Superpowers | BMAD Method | Oh My OpenAgent |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Optional technical and/or product interview | No built-in interview | No built-in interview | `/office-hours` + plan reviews with `/autoplan` | `/plan` and multi-plan; no built-in interview evidenced | Mandatory Socratic brainstorming before planning | Guided brainstorming and PRDs; adaptable depth | [Prometheus interview with optional dual review](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent/blob/32d5a4e31746cf936e238ef31ea2cea53d5f02ac/docs/guide/orchestration.md#planning-prometheus--metis--momus--oracle); [optional `/hyperplan`](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent/blob/32d5a4e31746cf936e238ef31ea2cea53d5f02ac/docs/reference/features.md#commands) |

I currently prefer having the option to interview before planning when the
problem is still unclear, without imposing that step on straightforward tasks.
Angel AI draws ideas from
[`grill-me`](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills) and
[`gstack`](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack) to challenge product requirements
and technical decisions before writing the plan. <br/>
It's much better to iterate before you start developing than after the code is already written.

## Memory

| Angel AI | Gentle AI | Oh My Pi | gstack | ECC | Superpowers | BMAD Method | Oh My OpenAgent |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| No built-in memory | Engram: semantic memory | Hindsight: semantic memory | `/learn`: patterns; optional GBrain semantic memory | Persistent session state, learned skills, and metrics | Design/plan documents; memory inherited from the harness | `.memlog.md` + `project-context.md`; not semantic memory | [Git-backed per-agent memory with reflection and search; on by default](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent/blob/32d5a4e31746cf936e238ef31ea2cea53d5f02ac/docs/reference/configuration.md#memory) |

I am still testing alternatives.<br/>
In any case, if the retained context is poor, incomplete, or stale, it can mislead the agent and be worse than having no memory.

## Specs

| Angel AI | Gentle AI | Oh My Pi | gstack | ECC | Superpowers | BMAD Method | Oh My OpenAgent |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Direct workers from a confirmed Brief | Custom SDD with Engram, OpenSpec, or both | Custom system | `/spec`: 5 phases, quality gate, and archive | Plans and guides; no dedicated spec lifecycle | Approved design + detailed implementation plan | PRD, architecture, stories, readiness, and validation | [Interviewed Markdown plans in `.omo/plans` + boulder-tracked execution](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent/blob/32d5a4e31746cf936e238ef31ea2cea53d5f02ac/docs/guide/orchestration.md#start-work-behavior-and-session-continuity) |

I have been working with specs since January when the Ralph loop became popular. I have tried multiple tools like OpenSpec, Spec Kit, BMAD, GSD, and skills to generate ADRs or PRDs.<br/>
OpenCode 2 now uses a confirmed Brief and direct workers; the bundled spec workflow has been removed.


## Token savings and models

| Angel AI | Gentle AI | Oh My Pi | gstack | ECC | Superpowers | BMAD Method | Oh My OpenAgent |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| No specific optimizer | No specific optimizer | Hashline: 61% fewer output tokens with Grok 4 Fast | Browser routing + token/cost benchmark; no general savings claim | Routing, strategic compaction, and cost-aware skills; no general percentage | Inherited from the harness; not applicable to the methodology | Web bundles with flat-rate subscriptions; no evidenced dynamic optimizer | [Category/model routing](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent/blob/32d5a4e31746cf936e238ef31ea2cea53d5f02ac/docs/reference/features.md#category-system), [preemptive compaction, and output truncation](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent/blob/32d5a4e31746cf936e238ef31ea2cea53d5f02ac/docs/reference/features.md#truncation--context-management); no general percentage |

I am skeptical of the optimizers. I saw in some benchmarks that they don't result in an actual reduction in the number of tokens without affecting the model's performance, so I'm not using them:<br/>

## Final code review

| Angel AI | Gentle AI | Oh My Pi | gstack | ECC | Superpowers | BMAD Method | Oh My OpenAgent |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Optional; up to 3 selected reviewers | Mandatory; 1 lens or 4R depending on risk | Optional; between 1 and 16 reviewers depending on the change | `/review`, QA, and `/ship`; optional `/codex` | Review and quality gates available; no universal final gate | Two reviews per task + branch verification | Layered adversarial review; no universal invocation | [`review-work`: 5 parallel lenses; required before PR handoff or on explicit request](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent/blob/32d5a4e31746cf936e238ef31ea2cea53d5f02ac/packages/shared-skills/skills/review-work/SKILL.md#review-work---5-agent-parallel-review-orchestrator) |

My current preference is to be able to choose. Gentle AI makes
it a mandatory gate and reserves its four 4R reviewers for sensitive or large
changes; Angel AI lets users choose up to three perspectives; Oh My Pi
automatically adjusts `/review` parallelism to the size of the diff. Oh My
OpenAgent runs five parallel lenses before PR handoff or when explicitly
requested.
